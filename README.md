I am a __holistic engineer__, driven by the understanding that every aspect of a project is interconnected. This holistic perspective empowers me to solve complex challenges and continuously enhance projects in a safe and efficient manner. While it’s true that no one can master everything, I have never embraced the idea of narrow specialization.

I have extensive experience in the software development industry, having worked on a diverse range of projects spanning telecom, device drivers, virtualization, cybersecurity, blockchain, and more. I excel at designing software solutions and writing code in several major programming languages. Additionally, my expertise in reverse engineering enables me to comprehend the functionality of any software even in the absence of documentation or source code.

Beyond my day job, I’m constantly exploring what’s next in technology. I love diving deep into Web3 and AI, and I use AI assistants as my research partners to handle the heavy lifting. This lets me focus on the most exciting part: figuring out how these advanced technologies can be used to create real, practical value for people and businesses.
