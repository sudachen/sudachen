I am a __holistic engineer__, driven by the understanding that every aspect of a project is interconnected. My goal is to not only grasp the big picture but also develop the skills needed to address any part of the process. This holistic perspective empowers me to solve complex challenges and continuously enhance projects in a safe and efficient manner. While it’s true that no one can master everything, I have never embraced the idea of narrow specialization.

I have extensive experience in the software development industry, having worked on a diverse range of projects spanning telecom, device drivers, virtualization, cybersecurity, blockchain, and more. I excel at designing software solutions and writing code in several major programming languages. Additionally, my expertise in reverse engineering enables me to comprehend the functionality of any software even in the absence of documentation or source code.

My innate curiosity drives me to explore a broad range of disciplines. In addition to writing software, I design and build custom electronics for home automation, weld metal structures, work with wood, and even repair my own cars. My interests also extend beyond engineering—I am deeply fascinated by anthropology, particularly the study of human interaction and the evolution of society as a living organism. This wide-ranging curiosity not only fuels my passion for engineering but also inspires me to tackle diverse challenges, including those with a social dimension.
