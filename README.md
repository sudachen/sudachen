> _I’m a holistic software engineer, and it means I strive to understand the entire project and be able to do any part of the work on it._ 

I have been working in the software development industry for many years and have been involved in projects related to a wide variety of things, such as telecom, device drivers, virtualization, cybersecurity, blockchain, etc. I’m fluent in designing software solutions and writing in several major programming languages. My offsec skills and talent to reverse engineering let me understand how any given software works even without documentation.
