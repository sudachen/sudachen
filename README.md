> _I'm a __holistic software engineer__, and it means I strive to understand the entire project and be able to do any part of the work on it. That holistic view of the project gives me the ability to solve complex issues and improve the project continuously and safely._ 

I have been working in the software development industry for many years and have been involved in projects related to a wide variety of things, such as telecom, device drivers, virtualization, cybersecurity, blockchain, etc. Iâ€™m fluent in designing software solutions and writing in several major programming languages. My offsec skills and talent to reverse engineering let me understand how any given software works even without documentation.
