> _Iâ€™m a true hacker. I research in deep stuff that attracts my attention to learn how it works and how it can be used curiously. It doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s about things, computer software or even people._**

Iâ€™ve been working in software development industry for more than 20 years. I worked in diverse projects related to many things like telecom services, gamedev, mobile software, embedded systems, UEFI drivers, smart cards, virtualization, etc.

Iâ€™m fluent in designing software solutions and writing in several major programming languages (Go, Python, C, C++, Scala, Rust). Additionally I design and build my own hardware from scratch for fun.
