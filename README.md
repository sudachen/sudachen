I'm a __holistic engineer__, and it means I strive to understand the entire project I'm working on and be able to complete any part of the work on it. That holistic approach to the project gives me the ability to solve complex issues and continuously and safely improve the project. While no one can know everything, I am not a fan of narrow specialization.

While no one can know everything, I am not a fan of narrow specialization. Therefore, I not only write software, but also create my own electronics for home automation from scratch, weld metal structures, work with wood, repair my cars, etc... I also love studying people from an anthropological perspective. The interaction of people and the evolution of society as a living organism. So I work on a lot of different engineering problems, including social ones.
