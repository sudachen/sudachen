I am a __holistic engineer__, driven by the understanding that every aspect of a project is interconnected. This holistic perspective empowers me to solve complex challenges and continuously enhance projects in a safe and efficient manner. While it’s true that no one can master everything, I have never embraced the idea of narrow specialization.

I have extensive experience in the software development industry, having worked on a diverse range of projects spanning telecom, device drivers, virtualization, cybersecurity, blockchain, and more. I excel at designing software solutions and writing code in several major programming languages. Additionally, my expertise in reverse engineering enables me to comprehend the functionality of any software even in the absence of documentation or source code.

My innate curiosity drives me to explore a broad range of disciplines. In addition to writing software, I design and build custom electronics for home automation, weld metal structures, work with wood, and even repair my own cars. My interests also extend beyond engineering - I am deeply fascinated by anthropology, particularly the study of human interaction and the evolution of society as a living organism. This wide-ranging curiosity not only fuels my passion for engineering but also inspires me to tackle diverse challenges, including those with a social dimension.

Beyond my day job, I’m constantly exploring what’s next in technology. I love diving deep into Web3 and AI, and I use AI assistants as my research partners to handle the heavy lifting. This lets me focus on the most exciting part: figuring out how these advanced technologies can be used to create real, practical value for people and businesses.

A few things I’m working as a background research:   
* __Owned Coding Assistant__: An open-source command line AI coding assistant I built to support both cloud and locally hosted LLMs, without the vendor lock-in or unpredictable limitations. [github.com/sudachen/coding-partner](https://github.com/sudachen/coding-partner)
* __Making Web3 instant__: Low-latency UDP/QUIC based communication layer for real-time dApps, using some powerful networking features in Linux (XDP). [github.com/sudachen/xdp-rs](https://github.com/sudachen/xdp-rs)
