I am a __holistic engineer__, driven by the ambition to understand every aspect of the projects I work on. My goal is to not only comprehend the big picture but also possess the skills to tackle any part of the process. This holistic approach enables me to solve complex challenges and continuously improve projects in a safe and efficient manner. While itâ€™s true that no one can know everything, I have never been a fan of narrow specialization.

I have extensive experience in the software development industry, having worked on a diverse range of projects spanning telecom, device drivers, virtualization, cybersecurity, blockchain, and more. I excel at designing software solutions and writing code in several major programming languages. Additionally, my expertise in reverse engineering enables me to comprehend the functionality of any software even in the absence of documentation or source code.

My aversion to narrow specialization inspires me to explore various disciplines. Beyond writing software, I design and build custom electronics for home automation from scratch, weld metal structures, work with wood, and even repair my own cars. My interests extend beyond engineering I'm fascinated by anthropology, studying human interaction and the evolution of society as a living organism. This wide-ranging curiosity fuels my work on diverse engineering challenges, including those with a social dimension.
