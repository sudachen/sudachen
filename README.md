I'm a __holistic software engineer__, and it means I strive to understand the entire project and be able to complete any part of the work on it. That holistic approach to the project gives me the ability to solve complex issues and continuously and safely improve the project. While no one can know everything, I am not a fan of narrow specialization.

I am a supporter of the idea that specialization is the lot of insects (rephrase of Robert Heinlein from “Time Enough For Love”).

I have been working in the software development industry for many years and have been involved in projects related to a wide variety of things, such as telecom, device drivers, virtualization, cybersecurity, blockchain, etc. I’m fluent in designing software solutions and writing in several major programming languages. My offsec skills and talent to reverse engineering let me understand how any given software works even without documentation.

It would be strange if I limited myself to programming only. I create my own electronics for home automation from scratch. I weld metal structures. Work with wood. Tune (and partially repair) my cars, etc...

I would like to work on developing cutting-edge interdisciplinary projects at the intersection of service decentralization, consumer robotics and applied artificial intelligence. I want to put my passion into creating a world where people don't have to do unloved work to live. A world where people can create without worrying about where they will live tomorrow or what to eat.
